                    Before E3, game publishers went to other trade shows to display new or upcoming products; 
                    these include the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and the European Computer Trade Show. As 
                    the game industry grew rapidly during the early 1990s, industry professionals felt that it 
                    had outgrown the older trade shows. According to Tom Kalinske, CEO of Sega America, 
                    "The CES organizers used to put the video games industry way, way in the back. In 1991 they put us in a tent, 
                    and you had to walk past all the porn vendors to find us. That particular year it was pouring rain, and 
                    the rain leaked right over our new Genesis system. I was just furious with the way CES treated 
                    the video games industry, and I felt we were a more important industry than they were giving us credit for.
                    " Sega did not return to the CES the following year, and several other companies exited from further CES shows.
                    <br><br>
                    Separately, in 1994, the video game industry had formed the Interactive Digital Software Association 
                    (IDSA, later becoming the Entertainment Software Association, ESA, in 2003) in response to attention 
                    the industry had drawn from the United States Congress over a lack of a ratings system in late 1993. 
                    The IDSA was formed to unify the video game industry and establish a commission, the Entertainment Software 
                    Ratings Board (ESRB) to create a voluntary standard rating system that was approved by Congress.

                    Following the 2006 convention, IDGA—now ESA—found that many exhibitors were worried about the high 
                    costs of presenting at the event, spending between $5–$10 million for their booths.They had also 
                    found that a larger proportion of attendees were bloggers and attendees who were not perceived to 
                    be industry professionals by vendors, managing to secure access to the conference. These additional 
                    attendees diluted the vendors' ability to reach out to their target audience, retailers and journalists.
                    Both of these reasons had previously caused the COMDEX trade show to shut down.Several large vendors 
                    told the ESA that they were going to pull out of the next E3, which would have had a domino effect on other vendors.
                    <br><br>
                    To avoid this, the ESA announced in July 2006 that E3 would be downsized and restructured due to the 
                    overwhelming demand from the exhibitors, and would limit attendees to those from the media and retail sectors.
                    For 2007 and 2008, E3 was renamed to the E3 Media and Business Summit, and moved into the July timeframe, 
                    about two months later in the year than previous shows. The 2007 show was held at the Barker Hanger at 
                    the Santa Monica Airport and other nearby hotels in Santa Monica, California, limited attendance to 
                    about 10,000.The 2008 event returned to the Los Angeles Convention Center, but also capped attendance at about 5,000

                                Responding to the complaints from the previous two years, the ESA announced that 
                                the 2009 E3 would be more open, but capping attendance at about 45,000 and closed to the
                                 public, as to achieve a balance between the two extremes. All subsequent E3s have taken place 
                                 in June of the calendar year at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

                                Starting in 2013, some of the major video game companies, particularly Nintendo and 
                                Electronic Arts, have opted not to showcase at E3. In Nintendo's case, they have foregone 
                                a large keynote presentation and instead have used pre-recorded Nintendo Direct and live video
                                 events during the E3 week since 2013 to showcase their new products, though they still run 
                                 floor booths for hands-on demonstrations.Electronic Arts since 2016 has set up a separate EA Play 
                                 event in a nearby locale to announce and exhibit their titles, citing the move as a result of the 
                                 lack of public access to the main E3 show.Other vendors, like Microsoft and Sony have used
                                  pre-E3 events to showcase hardware reveals, leaving the E3 event to cover new games for these systems.
                                <br><br>
                                Since 2015, the ESA has sought ways to bring public members to the event, as industry have 
                                seen increased publicity of their games through word-of-mouth by average gamers.
                                In 2015, 5000 tickets were distributed to vendors to be given to fans to be able to attend the event.
                                E3 2016 featured a separate but free "E3 Live" event at the nearby L.A. Live space that was to help 
                                provide a small-scale version of the E3 experience. While it drew about 20,000 people, it was found 
                                to be underwhelming.[26][27] In 2017, the ESA reserved 15,000 tickets to the convention for 
                                members of the public to buy;[28] these were all sold, leading to more than 68,000 attendees during 
                                E3 2017, which led to noticeable crowding and floor management issues.ESA confirmed that the 
                                2018 E3 will still include public passes, but that for two of the days, the event will be open only to 
                                industry attendees for three hours prior to admitting the public.
